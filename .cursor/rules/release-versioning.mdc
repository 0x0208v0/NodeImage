### Versioning and releases

- **Single source of truth**: Bump version in [nodeimage/__version__.py](mdc:nodeimage/__version__.py).
- **Dynamic wiring**: [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) reads `nodeimage.__version__.__version__` via `[tool.setuptools.dynamic]`.
- **CLI exposure**: Version available as `nodeimage.__version__` when importing the package.
- **Releasing**: After bumping, build and publish to PyPI as desired. README badges are fetched from PyPI and will reflect the latest release.
